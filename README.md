## Hi ! I'm Armand nice to meet you!

Student at [Epitech Bordeaux](https://www.epitech.eu/ecole-informatique-bordeaux/) 🎓, currently studying software development.  
My interest in coding has been growing as things start to actually make sense.<br/>

### What I’m focusing on right now
-  Web development, mostly through concrete projects rather than abstract exercises
-  Working on oldpartner, a personal project I use as my main learning playground
-  Data mining: understanding how useful information is extracted from raw data
-  Everything around data (formats, processing, logic), without trying to rush ahead<br/>

### How I learn
-  I move at my own pace
-  I take time to understand what’s blocking me
-  I test things, break them, and rebuild<br/>

### Current goal
Stop hacking things together randomly and start building real logic.<br/>
